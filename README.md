## Mumbai's rainfall Prediction

# Introduction

Mumbai's rainfall patterns are crucial for the city's water supply and overall well-being. 
This project leverages machine learning, specifically Random Forest regression, to predict monthly rainfall amounts based on historical data. 
The initial dataset provided is limited and contains only a few years of data, 
therefore this project should be considered a starting point, and expanded upon with larger and more complete datasets.


## Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file named `mumbai_rainfall.csv`. It contains the following columns:

-   **Year:** The year of the recorded rainfall.
-   **Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec:** Monthly rainfall amounts in millimeters.
-   **Total:** The annual total rainfall in millimeters.

## Performance of the model

* Accuracy of the model is  82.32%.
